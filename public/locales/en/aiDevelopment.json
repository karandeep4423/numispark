      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "items": {
        "cost": {
          "question": "What is the cost of an AI automation project?",
          "answer": "The cost varies considerably depending on complexity, features, and necessary integrations. A simple project can start around €3,000, while a complex multi-process solution can represent an investment of €50,000 or more. We offer phased approaches to spread the investment and progressively validate the concept."
        },
        "timeline": {
          "question": "How long does it take to implement an AI solution?",
          "answer": "Typical timelines vary from a few days for simple no-code automations to 3-6 months for complex custom solutions. Our agile approach allows us to deliver incremental functional versions, with a testable first version generally available within 2-4 weeks after project launch."
        },
        "difference": {
          "question": "What is the difference between classic automation and AI automation?",
          "answer": "Classic automation (RPA) works with fixed rules, while AI automation adds continuous learning, adaptability, natural language understanding, prediction, and intelligent decision-making. We recommend the most suitable approach based on your project, budget, and priorities."
        },
        "security": {
          "question": "How do you ensure data security in your solutions?",
          "answer": "Security is an absolute priority. We implement best practices: full GDPR compliance, secure hosting in Europe, sensitive data encryption, data minimization policy, regular security audits, and documented incident management processes."
        },
        "integration": {
          "question": "How do you handle integration with our existing systems?",
          "answer": "We develop secure APIs and connectors enabling seamless integration with your existing systems (CRM, ERP, e-commerce, etc.). Our expertise in development and system integration allows us to create solutions consistent with your current technical ecosystem."
        },
        "maintenance": {
          "question": "Do you offer maintenance services after deployment?",

        },
        "replacement": {
          "question": "Will AI replace our teams?",
          "answer": "No, AI doesn't replace your teams, it augments them. The goal is to eliminate repetitive low-value tasks to allow your employees to focus on higher-value activities: creativity, strategy, customer relations, innovation."
        },
        "measurement": {
          "question": "How do you measure the success of an AI automation project?",
          "answer": "We define relevant KPIs together (time savings, cost reduction, quality improvement, revenue increase) and implement analytics tools to track them. Regular reports allow you to evaluate performance and identify improvement opportunities."
        },
        "testing": {
          "question": "Can I test before investing massively?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We systematically recommend a progressive approach: proof of concept (PoC) for technical validation on limited scope, pilot on a specific service/process, then progressive scaling and extension. This approach minimizes risks and validates ROI at each stage."
        },
        "audit": {
          "question": "Do you offer a free audit?",
