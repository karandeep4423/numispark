      "timeline": {
        "question": "How long does it take to complete a design project?",
        "answer": "Timelines vary depending on the complexity of your project. A simple design can be completed in 2-3 weeks, while a complete redesign or complex application may require several months. However, our iterative approach allows you to quickly visualize the first creative directions and progressively refine the design."
      },
      "collaboration": {
        "question": "How does collaboration with your design team work?",
        "answer": "After an initial briefing to understand your objectives, we establish a transparent collaboration process with clearly defined validation stages.

        "answer": "Our standard deliverables include source design files (Figma, XD, Sketch), graphic assets optimized for development, documentation of interactions and animations, a style guide or design system, and technical specifications for developers. For more complex projects, we also provide interactive prototypes, detailed implementation guides, and support during the development phase."
      },
      "development": {
        "question": "How do you ensure the design will be easy to develop?",
        "answer": "Our design team works closely with developers to ensure our creations are technically feasible and optimized for implementation. We use practices like modular design, design systems, and detailed technical documentation. Our designers understand technical constraints and create interfaces that combine aesthetics and feasibility, reducing gaps between design and development."
      },
      "accessibility": {
        "question": "How do you approach accessibility in your designs?",
        "answer": "Accessibility is integrated from the beginning of our design process. We follow WCAG standards and test our interfaces with various accessibility tools. We pay particular attention to color contrasts, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and text alternatives. Our goal is to create inclusive designs that work for all users, regardless of their abilities, without compromising aesthetics or overall experience."
      },
      "implementation": {
        "question": "Do you also handle the development of your designs?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Our expertise extends from design to development, allowing us to ensure faithful implementation of your mockups. Our design and development teams work in synergy to ensure that every pixel and interaction is perfectly reproduced. If you already have a development team, we provide all necessary assets and documentation, and can provide follow-up during implementation to ensure the quality of the final result."
      },
      "success": {
        "question": "How do you measure the success of a design?",
        "answer": "We define with you success metrics aligned with your business objectives: conversion rate, user engagement, bounce rate, user satisfaction, etc. After launch, we analyze this data to evaluate the design's impact and identify optimization opportunities. Our data-driven approach allows us to continuously evolve the design to maximize its performance, combining aesthetics and measurable effectiveness."
