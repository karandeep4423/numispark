Technical corrections can show rapid improvements, while content and netlinking strategies require more time to bear fruit. Our approach prioritizes quick wins while building a sustainable long-term strategy."

        "seoVsSea": {
          "question": "What is the difference between SEO and SEA (Google Ads)?",
          "answer": "SEO (natural referencing) aims to improve your visibility in non-paid organic results, while SEA (Search Engine Advertising) concerns paid ads. SEO is a long-term investment that generates sustainable traffic without cost per click, but requires time to show results. SEA offers immediate visibility but with ongoing cost per click. The ideal strategy often combines these two approaches in a complementary way, and we can advise you on the optimal mix."

We can handle your entire content strategy, from keyword research to writing and optimization, or work in collaboration with your internal teams according to your preferences."

        "allIndustries": {
          "question": "Does SEO work for all business sectors?",
          "answer": "SEO is beneficial for virtually all sectors, but strategies and expectations must be adapted to each context. Some highly competitive markets (such as finance or insurance) require larger investments and increased patience, while less contested niches can show faster results. Our expertise covers many B2B and B2C sectors, and we adapt our approach to the specifics of your market, whether it's e-commerce, professional services, SaaS, or specialized industries."
