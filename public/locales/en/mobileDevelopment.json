        "cost": {
          "question": "What is the cost of developing a mobile application?",
          "answer": "The cost varies considerably depending on complexity, features, and target platforms. A simple MVP can start around €10,000, while a complex multi-platform application with advanced backend can represent an investment of €50,000 or more. We offer phased approaches to spread the investment and progressively validate the concept."
        },
        "timeline": {
          "question": "How long does it take to develop a mobile application?",
          "answer": "Typical timelines vary from 1-2 months for an MVP to 3-5 months for a complete multi-platform application. Our agile approach allows delivering incremental functional versions, with a first testable version generally available within 2-4 weeks after project launch."
        },
        "nativeVsCross": {
          "question": "What is the difference between a native and cross-platform application?",
          "answer": "Native applications are developed specifically for iOS or Android, offering optimal performance and complete access to device features. Cross-platform solutions (React Native, Flutter) allow developing a single codebase for both platforms, reducing costs and timelines. We recommend the most appropriate approach based on your project, budget, and priorities."
        },
        "security": {
          "question": "How do you ensure data security in your applications?",
          "answer": "Security is an absolute priority. We implement best practices: sensitive data encryption, secure authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT), protection against SQL injections and XSS, GDPR compliance, regular security audits, and proactive updates against new vulnerabilities."
        },
        "storePublishing": {
          "question": "How do you handle publishing on stores (App Store and Google Play)?",
          "answer": "We handle the entire publishing process: asset preparation (icons, screenshots), ASO-optimized description writing, product listing configuration, store submission, and validation feedback management. We also guide you in creating developer accounts if necessary."
        },
        "maintenance": {
          "question": "Do you offer maintenance services after launch?",
          "answer": "Yes, we offer several maintenance packages adapted to your needs: technical maintenance (bug fixes, compatibility with new OS), evolutionary maintenance (new features), and user support. Our maintenance contracts start from €500/month and include guaranteed response time and regular reports."
        },
        "integration": {
          "question": "How do you integrate my application with my existing systems?",
          "answer": "We develop secure APIs and connectors allowing seamless integration with your existing systems (CRM, ERP, e-commerce, etc.). Our expertise in backend development and systems integration allows us to create solutions consistent with your current technical ecosystem."
        },
        "success": {
          "question": "How do you measure the success of a mobile application?",
          "answer": "We define relevant KPIs together (downloads, retention, engagement, conversions) and implement analytics tools to track them. Regular reports allow you to evaluate performance and identify improvement opportunities. Our data-driven approach guides future application evolutions."
